1. Selecting correct libraries to link with gcc-arm-none-eabi-6-2017-q1-update

When first created the project in CCS 10.4 got the linker error undefined reference to `__sync_synchronize'

To get the project to link under Build -> GNU Linker -> Miscellaneous added the -mcpu=cortex-r4 and -mfpu=vfpv3-d16 options
