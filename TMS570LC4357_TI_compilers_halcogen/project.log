	!TOOL: 'Arm Compiler' (com.ti.ccstudio.buildDefinitions.TMS470_TICLANG_1.0.exe.compilerDebug.646691302)

		!NOTE: Source-tool setting '--code_state=32 -mv7R5' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-march=armv7r -marm'

		!NOTE: Source-tool setting '--float_support=VFPv3D16 -mv7R5' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-mfloat-abi=hard -mfpu=vfpv3-d16'

		!NOTE: Source-tool setting '--endian=big -mv7R5' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-mbig-endian'

		!NOTE: Source-tool default '--c89 --relaxed_ansi' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-std=gnu90'

		!NOTE: Source-tool default '--c++14 --relaxed_ansi' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-std=gnu++14'

		!NOTE: Source-tool setting '-mv7R5' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-mcpu=cortex-r5'

		!NOTE: Source-tool default '-Ooff' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-O0'
			tiarmclang's -O0 option disables optimization

		!NOTE: Source-tool setting: 
				--include_path="${PROJECT_ROOT}" --include_path="${PROJECT_ROOT}/include" --include_path="${CG_TOOL_ROOT}/include" 
			has been migrated to target-tool setting: 
				-I"${PROJECT_ROOT}" -I"${PROJECT_ROOT}/include" -I"${CG_TOOL_ROOT}/include"

		!NOTE: Source-tool setting '-g' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-gdwarf-3'

		!NOTE: Source-tool default '--wchar_t=16' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-fno-short-wchar'
			tiarmclang does not support 16-bit wchar_t in its runtime libraries; the --wchar_t=16 option will map to tiarmclang's -fno-short-wchar option (32-bit wchar_t type assumed)

		!NOTE: Source-tool setting '--exceptions' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-fno-exceptions'
			C++ exception handling is not supported in the current tiarmclang compiler toolchain; --exceptions option ignored

		!NOTE: Source-tool default '--common=on' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-fcommon'

		!NOTE: Source-tool default '' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-Werror=ti-pragmas -Werror=ti-macros -Werror=ti-intrinsics'
			use of legacy TI pragmas will be flagged as errors
			use of legacy TI pre-defined macro symbols will be flagged as errors
			use of legacy TI intrinsics will be flagged as errors

		!WARNING: The following source-tool settings were not migrated because no migration rules have been defined - please migrate these settings manually, if applicable: 
				--diag_warning=225 --diag_wrap=off --display_error_number
