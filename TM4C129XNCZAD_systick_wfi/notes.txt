==================================
2nd run, but single stepped and set the initial timer_period to 5850 to get closer to the failure point in the 1st run.

Got a hard fault for:
num_wakeups	unsigned int	726833	0x2000022C	
total_sys_tick_interrupts	unsigned int	365767	0x20000220	
total_timer_interrupts	unsigned int	372787	0x20000224	
timer_period	unsigned int	5923	0x2000020C	

And the addition of the GEL script from https://e2e.ti.com/support/tools/ccs/f/81/p/810598/3026599#3026599 to automate the stack unwind
shows the problematic PC was again 0x2AC. 

Same faulrt locartion as before:
NVIC_FAULT_STAT	0x00008200	Configurable Fault Status [Memory Mapped]	
NVIC_FAULT_ADDR	0x0138EEA5	Bus Fault Address [Memory Mapped]	

================================
3rd run power cycled and left running without debugger attached.

No hard fault when left running (omitted to record how long had been run for).

After attaching debugger:
num_wakeups	unsigned int	1126826797	0x2000022C	
total_sys_tick_interrupts	unsigned int	274395735	0x20000220	
total_timer_interrupts	unsigned int	880220327	0x20000224	
timer_period	unsigned int	3670	0x2000020C	

Based upon the total_sys_tick_interrupts had run for 9.6 times longer than the 1st failure and timer_period has wrapped around.

With the debugger attached set running, with the Expressions set to continuous refresh.

Which then stopped with a hard fault with:
num_wakeups	unsigned int	1152019250	0x2000022C	
total_sys_tick_interrupts	unsigned int	285672151	0x20000220	
total_timer_interrupts	unsigned int	894588989	0x20000224	
timer_period	unsigned int	5925	0x2000020C	

Unwinding the stack with the GEL script ended up with the PC as 0x472 in main (instruction after wfi).
However, may have made a mistake as got "CORTEX_M4_0: GEL Output: Unwound stack after an exception with non-floating point state" in the console
so might have first unwound to the timer ISR and then to main.

Fault registers the same as before:
NVIC_FAULT_STAT	0x00008200	Configurable Fault Status [Memory Mapped]	
NVIC_FAULT_ADDR	0x0138EEA5	Bus Fault Address [Memory Mapped]
