RM46_light_sensor
=================

For https://e2e.ti.com/support/development_tools/code_composer_studio/f/81/p/608704/2240771#2240771

Displays the ADC value from the light sensor on a LAUNCHXL2-RM46 on the serial port.
Developed using CCS 7.2 and HALCoGen 04.06.01.


TM4C_RTC_trim_overflow
======================

For https://e2e.ti.com/support/microcontrollers/tiva_arm/f/908/t/610515

Developed using CCS 7.2 and TivaWare 2.1.4.178.


66AK2H14_C66_system_trace_TCI6638K2K_device_file
================================================

Developed using CCS 7.2

This is a program for running on the C66xx_0 core on a 66AK2H14 on an EVMK2H which repeatidly
modifies a 1 Gbyte array in DDR memory in order to generate test traffic for the hardware trace analyser
type of "Memory Throughput Analysis".

For testing the EVMK2H was set to "DSP no boot mode" and the ..\..\emulation\boards\xtcievmk2x\gel\xtcievmk2x.gel script
used to configure the hardware.

The program has not been optimised for speed, and is updating the 1Gbyte array in approx 40 seconds,
which in theory is performing 26.8 Mbytes/sec read and 26.8 Mbytes/sec write.

The device in the target confguration has been set to TCI6638K2K due to the 66AK2H12 device file not containing
all required entries for tracing (https://e2e.ti.com/support/development_tools/code_composer_studio/f/81/t/511744)
