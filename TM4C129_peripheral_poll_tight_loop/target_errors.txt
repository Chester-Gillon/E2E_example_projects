Test of trying to get errors from CCS which halt the target after starting a debug session.
After starting the debug session started refreshing the UART0 register in the debugger and waited for about one minute
to see if any errors were reported.

Using software:
- CCS 7.3.0.00019 under Windows 10
- TI Emulators 7.0.48.0
- SEGGER J-Link Support (Windows) 6.20.9.0

1) Using a Stellaris-ICDI and the Stellaris Virtual Serial Port connected to the CCS Terminal

Got "CORTEX_M4_0: Error: Timed out while waiting for target powerup/polling a hardware resource" error when debugging:
IIIII IIIII IIII

Didn't get error:
IIIII I

2) Using a Segger J-Link and the Stellaris Virtual Serial Port connected to the CCS Terminal

Didn't get error:
IIIII IIIII IIIII IIIII

3) Using a Stellaris-ICDI and the Stellaris Virtual Serial Port NOT connected

Didn't get error:
IIIII IIIII IIIII IIIII
