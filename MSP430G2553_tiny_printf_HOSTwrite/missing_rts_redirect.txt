# _c_int00_noargs is reported as calling _auto_init, but the linker has changed to actually call _auto_init_hold_wdt instead
# Therefore, fake an indirect call from _c_int00_noargs to _auto_init_hold_wdt to prevent _auto_init_hold_wdt from being
# reported as orphaned.
# call_graph will still report the non-existant _init_init as being called.
# Ideally would be able to specify that _auto_init_hold_wdt is an alias of _auto_init, but call_graph doesn't allow
# function aliases to be specified in the re-direct files.
